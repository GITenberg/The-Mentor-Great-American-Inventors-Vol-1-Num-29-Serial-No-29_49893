<p>Anyone who reads the history of the United States must be
impressed with the supremely important part played by the
inventor in the evolution of the nation. The explorer and
pioneer, the statesman, diplomat, and soldier,&mdash;all these have contributed,
and contributed notably, to the upbuilding of the mighty republic
of today. But it is beyond dispute that in the long run their efforts
would have counted for comparatively little had it not been for the genius
of those who have bent their energies to the devising of means for the
development of the country’s marvelously rich resources, and have
still further added to the national wealth by the creation of unsuspected
channels for the profitable employment of human enterprise and labor.</p>

<p class="caption">WHITNEY’S ARMORY</p>

<p class="caption"><i>In 1798 the inventor of the cotton gin began the manufacture
of firearms near New Haven, Connecticut.</i></p>

</div>

<p>It was in the humble workshops of men like Whitney, Fitch, and
Fulton that, almost as soon as the independence of the United States had
been won by the sword, the foundations were laid for its rise to the
standing of a world power. Every invention these men made meant
a gain in the nation’s strength, and
a wider opening of the door of opportunity
to all native-born Americans,
and to the constantly increasing host
of newcomers from abroad. The
American inventors have not simply
astonished mankind; they have enhanced
the prestige, power, and prosperity
of their country.</p>

<h3>THE COTTON GIN</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus02b.jpg" width="300" height="224" alt="" />

<p class="caption">BIRTHPLACE OF WHITNEY</p>

<p class="caption"><i>In this house in Westborough, Massachusetts,
Eli Whitney was born on December 8, 1765.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Take, for example, the results
that have flowed from a single invention,
that of the Whitney cotton gin. When the young Yankee schoolmaster
and law student, Eli Whitney, was graduated from Yale and
settled in Georgia in 1792, the production of cotton in the Southern
States was insignificant. At that time, indeed, cotton was grown by the
Southerners chiefly for decorative effect in gardens, because of its handsome
flowers. Its cultivation for commercial purposes was virtually out of
the question, owing to the fact that no means were available for economically
separating the lint from the seed. This had to be done by hand,
and since it took ten hours for a quick worker to separate one pound of
lint from its three pounds of seed no adequate returns could be had.</p>

<p>What was needed, as his southern friends pointed out to Whitney,
was the invention of some apparatus for performing the work of separation
cleanly and quickly. The problem was one that appealed to him
with peculiar force. Even as a boy in
Massachusetts he had been fond of tinkering
with mechanical appliances. At
the early age of twelve he had made a
violin of fairly good tone; a year later
he was making excellent knives; and
before he was fifteen he was recognized
as the best mechanic in his native town
of Westborough. It was therefore with
real enthusiasm that he set up a workshop
in the basement of his Georgia
home, and varied his law studies by experimenting
in the manufacture of a
cotton gin. Within a few months he
had successfully completed his self-imposed task by the creation of a
machine equipped with hundreds of tiny metal fingers, each of which
did more work in quicker time than the human hand could possibly do.</p>

<p>That same year (1793) fully five million pounds of cotton were
harvested in the United
States, the product of
a planting stimulated
solely by faith in the
Whitney gin. By the
year of Whitney’s death
(1825) cotton was indisputably
king in the
commercial life of the
nation, the value of the
cotton exports for that
year being more than
$36,000,000, as against
a valuation of barely
$30,000,000 for all other American
exports. The eventual
abolition of slavery served
only to accentuate the stupendous
importance of the cotton
gin. Under free labor the
production of cotton has
steadily risen, until nowadays
it annually runs into the billions
of pounds, with a valuation
of many hundreds of millions
of dollars, and affords
employment not only to an
enormous army of cultivators, but to a still greater army of workers in
factory, office, and store.</p>

<p class="caption">THE FULTON HOMESTEAD</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The inventor purchased this farm in Washington
County, Pennsylvania, when he was but
twenty-one years of age. Here he left his mother
when he went to England to study art.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Even of much greater importance have been the results of the labors of
another illustrious American inventor, Robert Fulton. Born in Lancaster
County, Pennsylvania,
in November, 1765,
Fulton, by reason of the
astonishing number
and variety of his inventions,
may well be called
the Edison of his time.</p>

<h3>ROBERT FULTON</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus03b.jpg" width="300" height="228" alt="" />

<p class="caption">ROBERT FULTON</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Fulton was tall, and his face showed great intelligence. He was
refined, and possessed grace and elegance of manner.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Similar to all truly
great inventors, he
was a man of broad
vision and keen imagination.
What he was
most interested in was
not immediate consequences,
but ultimate effects, and in working on the complicated mechanical
problems with which his mind was incessantly occupied he kept
steadily in view their significance to society as a whole. Thus, one of his
most ingenious creations&mdash;the famous Fulton torpedo, crude forerunner
of the deadly submarine missiles of today&mdash;was inspired by an ardent
desire to produce something that would make war so terrible as to impel
mankind to universal peace. And similarly it was with an eye to increasing
the welfare and happiness of society that he went to work on the
invention with which his name will always be linked,&mdash;the steamboat.</p>

<p>He was not the first to whom the idea had occurred of applying the
steam engine to purposes of water transportation. Already the Pennsylvanian,
William Henry, the Connecticut mechanic, John Fitch, the New
Jersey inventor, John Stevens, and the Scotsman, William Symington, had
demonstrated more or less successfully
the possibility of
using steam as a motive power
on the water; but it was left to
Fulton to establish definitely
the value of the steamboat as
a medium for passenger and freight traffic.
This he did with his historic Clermont,
built at New York in 1807, partly with
funds provided by Chancellor Livingston
and partly by loans from reluctant and
skeptical friends.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus04a.jpg" width="300" height="178" alt="" />

<p class="caption">FULTON’S FIRST EXPERIMENT WITH PADDLE WHEELS</p>

<p class="caption"><i>In the summer of 1779 Fulton first tried the method of propelling a boat
by means of paddle wheels on Conestoga Creek in eastern Pennsylvania.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The general impression was that Fulton
had undertaken a hopeless and visionary
task. “As I had occasion,” he
himself has related, “daily to pass to and from the shipyard while my
boat was in progress, I often loitered unknown near idle groups of strangers,
gathering in little circles, and heard various inquiries as to the
object of this new vehicle. The language was uniformly that of scorn,
sneer, or ridicule. The loud laugh often rose at my expense; the dry
jest; the wise calculation of losses and expenditures; the dull but endless
repetition of ‘Fulton’s Folly.’”</p>

<p>As everybody knows, the Clermont
did not sink or otherwise
come to grief when she started up
the Hudson, August 11, 1807, for
her maiden voyage to Albany. On
the contrary, she made the journey,
against the wind, at an average rate
of nearly five miles an hour; and,
with the wind again ahead, returned to New York at about the same
speed. Compared with the steaming powers of the modern ocean
leviathan, this was a sorry enough showing; but, with the continued
success of the Clermont and her sister boats, the Raritan and the Car of
Neptune,&mdash;which together constituted the world’s first regular line of
steamboats,&mdash;it was sufficient to prove for all time that man had made
another superb advance in the
mastery of the forces of Nature.</p>

<h3>INVENTOR OF THE
SEWING MACHINE</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus05a.jpg" width="300" height="213" alt="" />

<p class="caption">BIRTHPLACE OF ELIAS HOWE</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Amid these humble surroundings the inventor of the sewing
machine was born at Spencer, Massachusetts, in 1819.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 235px;">

<p class="caption">BEFORE THE WAR</p>

<p class="caption"><i>A sewing machine of 1851.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Very different, but also of
great value, was the service
rendered by Elias Howe of
sewing machine fame. There
are two stories as to the genesis
of this wonderful labor-saving
device. One is that it was
suggested to Howe by the
chance remark of a visitor to
the Boston machine shop in
which he was employed. The
other and more romantic story
is that the idea of a machine for sewing garments
originated from a desire on Howe’s
part to lighten the labor of his wife, who,
when he was ill and out of work, was obliged
to take in sewing and toil far into the night.</p>

<p>Whichever version is correct, it is certain
that in 1843 (Howe was then only
twenty-four years old) he set to work in the
garret of his father’s home in Cambridge,
and about a year later gave to the world a
sewing machine that embodied the principal
features of the most up-to-date models of
the present day.
For long, however,
the world
was reluctant to
accept this splendid
invention.
The tailors of
Boston, to whom
he first offered it,
refused to adopt
it, on the ground that it would ruin their business;
and later, in New York, there were anti-sewing
machine demonstrations, fomented by
labor leaders, who failed to realize that in the
end labor-saving devices of any real merit were
always certain to increase, not decrease, the
demand and opportunities for the workingman
and workingwoman.</p>

<p class="caption">A SEWING MACHINE OF 1860</p>

<p class="caption">“<i>It has stitched many hundred miles of seam, and is
still in good working order.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>In the case of the sewing machine the truth
of this has long since been demonstrated. Not
only has it become a familiar household adjunct, freeing millions of
women from the slavery of the needle, and thus most effectively answering
the piteous plea of Hood’s “Song of the Shirt,” but it has also
brought about a marvelous expansion of the clothing industry. It has
in fact created an entirely new and most important branch of that industry,&mdash;the
ready-made clothing business,&mdash;giving employment to
hundreds of thousands of people, and providing well patterned and
well finished garments at prices undreamed of in other days. Surely
Howe, no less than Fulton and Whitney, deserves to be regarded
as a benefactor of humanity.</p>

<p>So, too, with Samuel F. B.
Morse, and Alexander Graham Bell, the one
the father of the electric telegraph, the other
the inventor of the telephone. If anybody
had told Samuel Morse in 1811, when as a
youth of twenty he sailed from New York to
Liverpool to
study painting
under Benjamin West, that he would
be known to posterity as an inventor rather
than as an artist, he would have laughed
the prophecy to scorn. But, as has happened
to other gifted men, circumstances
conspired to turn and fix the thoughts of
this brilliant son of New England on problems
unconnected with the routine of his daily
life, yet appealing to him with such force
as to change the whole course of his career.</p>

INSTRUMENT</p>

</div>

<p>With Morse the turning point was
reached in 1827 when, some years after his
return from England, he attended a course
of lectures in New York on the subject of
electromagnetism. What he then heard
fired his imagination, and led him, during
a second visit abroad, to study more closely
the nature of electricity. He specially
became interested in the possibility
of utilizing this great natural
force as a medium for long-distance
communication, and when homeward
bound, in the autumn of 1832, applied
himself to this one problem to
such good purpose that before landing
in New York he was able to
show to his fellow passengers plans
of the instrument that was to immortalize
his name.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Alexander Graham Bell opening the New York-Chicago
long distance telephone line, October 18, 1892.</i></p>

</div>

<p>It was not until five years afterward,
however, that Morse made
the first working demonstration of
his invention, which by most people
was regarded as a scientific toy rather
than a creation of the highest practical
utility. And a scientific toy it
remained until, after a heartbreaking
struggle to secure the necessary financial
aid, Morse persuaded Congress
in 1843 to appropriate $30,000 for
the construction of a telegraph line
between Washington and Baltimore.
The first message to be flashed over
this line, May 1, 1844, was the news
of the nomination of
Henry Clay for the presidency;
and with the sending
of that message one of
the greatest inventions in
the history of mankind definitely
gained recognition
as an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>Alexander Graham
Bell, experimenting in the
same field of long-distance
communication by the aid
of electricity, was more fortunate
in securing early
acknowledgment of the
merits of his telephone, a
public demonstration of
which was given at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876. Connected with
this invention a most interesting story is told. Bell, it is said, was experimenting
with a device for multiplex telegraphy, when the accidental
snapping of a wire sent a sound vibrating through another wire which
had attached to it at each end a thin sheet-iron disk a few inches in
circumference. At once Bell asked himself if the sound could be repeated.
Experiment showed that it could, and the query then suggested itself
to him, Could vocal sounds be thus transmitted? Forthwith he set himself
to the task that resulted,
after many failures, in the creation
of the telephone.</p>

<p>But even in the case of
this marvelous instrument it
was for a long time impossible
to obtain the necessary
financial support. When,
in 1877, Bell took the telephone
to England, he could
find no purchaser for half
the European rights at $10,000,
and in this country a
personal friend declined to
advance $2,500 for a half interest.
Today, so it is stated,
there are in use in the United States alone approximately seven and a
half million telephones.</p>

<p>Never has there been an American inventor who has contributed more
abundantly than Thomas Alva Edison to the republic’s industrial expansion,
nor one who has achieved greatness under a heavier handicap of
early disadvantages. Born (1847) of a poor family in an obscure Ohio

<p>It was as a telegrapher, which
he became at eighteen, that his
inventive genius first displayed
itself. One after another various
devices for improving telegraphic
service flowed from his fertile
mind, until, after his astonishing
success in inventing a duplex and

to command the support of a group

through a long series of experiments
that finally resulted in the
invention of the now familiar

on the gratitude of his countrymen

come from his New Jersey laboratory
a succession of inventions,&mdash;to name only a few, the phonograph,
the kinetoscope, the mimeograph, the storage battery, and the “talking
moving pictures,”&mdash;which have meant new openings for capital, new
opportunities for labor, and an incalculable enlargement of the resources
of the human race. Whitney, Fulton, Howe, Morse, Bell, Edison,&mdash;clearly
it is only simple historic justice to rate these great inventors with
the great statesmen, warriors, and pioneers who in days gone by have won
undying fame as makers of the American republic.</p>

<p class="dropcap">A machine said to have paid off the debts of the
South, greatly increased its capital, and trebled the
value of its land, was the invention of Eli Whitney.
This machine was the cotton gin. And, like many
another inventor, Whitney was rewarded with ingratitude.
He added hundreds of millions to the wealth of our country,
and in return had to endure humiliation
and vexation of body and spirit.</p>

<p>Eli Whitney was born at Westborough,
Massachusetts, on December 8, 1765. He
early showed great mechanical ability,
and by the time he was twenty-three years
old had earned enough money to enable
him to enter Yale. After graduating he
went to Savannah, Georgia, with the hope
of becoming a teacher there. He was disappointed
in this; but made the acquaintance
of Mrs. Nathanael Greene, widow of
the Revolutionary general, and paid a
visit to her plantation.</p>

<p>When he was there some men who were
also visiting Mrs. Greene happened one
day to lament the fact that there was no
machine for cleaning the staple cotton of
its seeds. This work had to be done by
hand and was very slow. Separating one
pound of the clean staple from the seed
was a day’s work for a negro woman.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Greene turned to them.
“Gentlemen,” she said, “apply to my
friend here, Mr. Whitney. He can make
anything.” And she showed them several
contrivances the young Northerner had
made.</p>

<p>Whitney modestly said that he did not
know how successful he would be, but that
he would try. In a few weeks he produced
a model, consisting of a wooden cylinder
encircled by rows of slender spikes set half
an inch apart, which extended between the
bars of a grid set so closely together that
the seeds could not pass, but the lint was
pulled through by the revolving spikes.
A revolving brush cleaned the spikes, and
the seed fell into another compartment.
This machine could clean fifty pounds of
cotton a day, as compared with one pound
a day cleaned by hand.</p>

<p>Whitney formed a partnership with
Phineas Miller, who later married Mrs.
Greene, and they built a factory at New
Haven to make cotton gins. This place
was burned to the ground in March, 1795,
and the partners were plunged into debt.
Several infringements of their patent then
appeared to discourage them still more,
and it was not until 1807 that Whitney’s
rights were established.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, however, the inventor
became disgusted with the struggle and
began manufacturing firearms for the government.
This proved profitable, and he
greatly improved the methods of making
arms. But from the cotton gin he received
little revenue.</p>

<p>His last years were the happiest. In
1817 he married Henrietta Edwards, the
youngest daughter of Judge Pierpont Edwards
of Connecticut. They had four
children, a son and three daughters. Whitney
died in New Haven on January 8,
1825.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Robert Fulton was not the inventor of the steamboat.
He was, however, the first man to apply the
power of the steam engine to the propulsion of boats
in a practical and effective manner. Born of poor
parents at Little Britain, now Fulton, Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania, in 1765, he received only the scantiest education;
but early showed promise of becoming an
excellent artist. At the age of seventeen
he took up painting seriously, and supported
himself thus in Philadelphia until
he was twenty-one.</p>

<p>Then he bought a farm in Washington
County; but soon after was strongly
advised to go to England for the purpose
of studying art under the American, Benjamin
West. There he met Earl Stanhope,
Duke of Bridgewater, who interested him
in engineering. In 1794 he took out an
English patent for superseding canal locks
by inclined planes. He also invented
about this time a new method for sawing
marble, a machine for spinning flax, and
another for making ropes.</p>

<p>Soon after this he went to Paris, and
built a submarine, the <i>Nautilus</i>. This
boat was tried in Brest Harbor in 1801,
before a commission appointed by Napoleon
Bonaparte, and Fulton succeeded in
blowing up a small vessel anchored there
for that purpose. Two years later, at Paris,
he was also successful in propelling a boat
by steam power.</p>

<p>Fulton returned to America, and in
partnership with Robert Livingston constructed
the first American steamboat, the
<i>Clermont</i>. This was launched in the spring
of 1807, and its success caused a great sensation.
The principle of propelling boats
by steam was now proved. The <i>Clermont</i>
was soon established as a regular passenger
boat between New York and Albany.</p>

<p>Fulton built the <i>Demologos</i>, or <i>Fulton
the First</i>, for the United States government
during the years 1814 and 1815.
This was the first steam battleship ever
constructed.</p>

<p>In February, 1815, the inventor caught
cold from exposure and rapidly became
worse. On February 24 he died, mourned
by everyone who had known the man and
his achievements.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It is a remarkable fact that some of the greatest and
most useful inventions have been bitterly opposed
by the very persons whom they were designed to
help. The bowmen of olden time resented the introduction
of guns; the stage coach lines tried in every way to
block the building of railways; and Elias Howe, the inventor
of one of the greatest labor saving devices
in the world, the sewing machine, was ridiculed,
discouraged, and denounced as an
enemy of poor sewing women, the ones
whose toil he was seeking to lighten. They
imagined that with the introduction of the
sewing machine their occupation would be
taken away.</p>

<p>Elias Howe was born at Spencer, Massachusetts,
on July 9, 1819, one of a family
of eight children. His father was a farmer
and miller, and Elias’ early years were
spent in the mill. At the same time he
managed to pick up a smattering of education.</p>

<p>He went to Lowell, Massachusetts, in
1835, to work in a cotton mill. Two years
later he obtained a place in a Cambridge
machine shop, in which his cousin, Nathaniel
P. Banks, afterward governor of Massachusetts,
was also employed.</p>

<p>Howe married at the age of twenty-one
and moved to Boston. It was there that
the first germs of his great idea became
implanted in his brain. To increase the
family income his wife did sewing at night.
As Howe watched her slowly and laboriously
stitching a seam, his inventive mind
sought and sought for some way to decrease
her toil. He had a natural bent for
mechanics, and it was not long before he
had constructed the first crude sewing
machine.</p>

<p>This was in October, 1844. But, although
he now had his idea, he lacked
money to prove its value. However, a
man named Fisher in Cambridge liked his
invention, and agreed to board Howe and
his family and to advance $500 in return
for a half interest in the patent. By the
middle of next May, Howe had constructed
a machine which did sewing that promised
to outlast the cloth.</p>

<p>But the invention was opposed everywhere
in America. Finally, in 1846,
Howe’s brother Amasa went to England,
and managed to sell the English rights in
the machine for $1,250 to a William
Thomas. This man also gave Elias Howe
a place in his factory at $15 a week. But
he treated the inventor shamefully, and
Howe threw up the situation. He sent his
family back to America ahead of him, and
then returned himself. He landed in New
York with less than a dollar in his pocket,
and was met with the news that his wife
was dying of consumption at Cambridge.
He managed to borrow some money, and
reached her side just before she passed
away.</p>

<p>These were Howe’s darkest days. Imitations
of his machine were infringing on
his patent, and he had to begin several
suits to establish his rights. He and another
man now began to manufacture
sewing machines in a small way. It was
during this time that the “sewing machine
riots” took place; but soon the real value
of the invention was seen, and all opposition
ceased.</p>

<p>Brighter times began for the inventor.
He won his patent suits, and by 1863 his
royalties were estimated at $4,000 a day!
At the Paris Exposition of 1867 he was
awarded a gold medal and the ribbon of
the Legion of Honor. His last years were
happy ones. He died on October 3, 1867.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The story has been told that the first words that ever
came over a telegraph instrument were “What hath
God Wrought!” and that they were spelled out by
Samuel F. B. Morse, the inventor of the telegraphic
code. This was supposed to have taken place in 1844 in Baltimore,
and to have proclaimed the fact that Morse’s dream of
telegraphy had become a reality. We are
now told on good authority that this was
not the first message to be sent by telegraph,
nor was Morse the sender of the
words. Instead, it was sent by one of the
committee who were debating upon the
proposal of Morse, the inventor, to string a
telegraph line from Baltimore to Washington.
Morse, who wanted to end the
discussion and at the same time demonstrate
his invention, strung a wire from
the committee room to the top of the Capitol.
One of the committee, who was opposed
to President Tyler, wrote, “Tyler
deserves to be hanged.” This was received
by the man at the other end exactly as it
was composed.</p>

<p>Samuel Finley Breese Morse was born
at Charlestown, Massachusetts, on April
27, 1791. He was the son of the Rev.
Jedediah Morse, and the great-grandson of
Samuel Finley, the second president of the
College of New Jersey at Princeton.</p>

<p>Morse entered Yale at the age of fourteen,
which was not considered extremely
young in those days. It was there that he
first began the study of electricity. But
his tastes led him more strongly toward
art than toward science, and in 1811 the
young graduate became the pupil of Washington
Allston and went with him to England.
Here he remained four years, distinguishing
himself with his brush and
making many friends.</p>

<p>During the next few years the young
artist traveled about New England, painting
portraits for the sum of $15 apiece.
Later he increased his price to $60 a portrait,
doing an average of four a week.
By the money thus earned he was enabled
to marry Miss Lucretia P. Walker on October
6, 1818.</p>

<p>In 1825 Morse was one of the founders
of the National Academy of Design, and
was its first president, from 1826 until
1845. He made a second visit to Europe
in 1829, and traveled about the Continent
for three years before returning to New
York.</p>

<p>During all this time, however, while he
was working at his art, Morse’s mind had
also been occupied with another interest.
That was electromagnetism, and the possibility
of communication between far distant
places by means of it.</p>

<p>It was on board the ship <i>Sully</i>, in which
he was returning to America, that he said,
“If the presence of electricity can be made
visible in any part of the circuit, I see no
reason why intelligence may not be transmitted
by electricity.” And in a few days
he had finished some rough plans of an
apparatus to do this.</p>

<p>But it was a twelve years’ struggle
against poverty and discouragement before
he could get any apparatus that
would work. Finally, however, he was
successful in this, and after taking out a
patent applied to Congress for money to
experiment with the telegraph over a circuit
of sufficient length to test its possibility
and value. After long delay he was
at last granted this in 1843. A line was
built from Baltimore to Washington, and
on May 24, 1844, Miss Ellsworth, daughter
of the Commissioner of Patents, sent the
first message from the chamber of the
Supreme Court in Washington to Baltimore.</p>

<p>Three years later Morse was compelled
to defend his invention in the courts, and
successfully proved his claim to be called
the inventor of the electromagnetic recording
telegraph. He married for the
second time in 1848.</p>

<p>In 1871 a bronze statue of Morse was
erected in Central Park, New York City,
and the following year, on April 2, the
great inventor died, simple, dignified, and
kindly to the end.</p>

<p class="dropcap">One hot afternoon in June, about forty years ago, a
young man was standing in a grimy workshop by
the side of a crude little machine composed of a
clock spring reed, a magnet, and a wire. He was
bending over this queer machine listening intently. Suddenly
he bent nearer, a startled look of excitement upon his face.
From the clock spring had come a faint,
almost inaudible sound. The young man
straightened up and ran into an adjoining
room, where another man stood near
a second instrument similar to the first.</p>

<p>“Snap that reed again!” he cried excitedly.</p>

<p>The assistant obeyed him, and again
came that faint twang from the spring in
the front room. The telephone was born!</p>

<p>And the man who accomplished this
wonder was a poor young professor of elocution
in Boston, Alexander Graham Bell.
He was not an American by birth. He was
born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 1,
1847. His father was Alexander Melville
Bell, the inventor of a system by which
the deaf can read speech by observing
the motion of the lips.</p>

<p>The Bell family moved to Canada in
1870, and Alexander, the younger, took up
teaching the deaf and dumb in Boston.
He became instructor of phonetics, or the
science of articulate sound, in Monroe’s
School of Oratory. He was a hard worker,
but poor. One time when he had rheumatism
his employer had to pay his hospital
expenses.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Bell began
experimenting with the transmission of
sound by electricity. For a number of
years other people had been trying to do
this. Sir Charles Wheatstone in England
had discovered that wires charged with
electricity often carried noises in a curious
way. In 1869 Reis, a German professor,
constructed an instrument that sent a
series of clicks along an electric wire to an
electromagnetic receiver at the other end.
And others were turning their attention
to this interesting phase of telegraphy.</p>

<p>But it was Alexander Graham Bell who
first succeeded in grasping the correct idea.
A few months after the incident described
above, on a day in January, 1876, he called
some of his pupils into a room and showed
them an instrument that transmitted singing
from the cellar of the building to where
they were on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>People were at first slow to appreciate
the importance of this great invention:
but gradually they came to see its value,
and today there are over seven million
telephones in use in the United States alone.</p>

<p>Money and honors have poured in upon
the inventor, who still lives to enjoy his
triumph. His income is said to be more
than $1,000,000 a year. In 1880 the
French government awarded him the
Volta prize of $10,000, and two years later
he received from the same country the
ribbon of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The scene&mdash;the Boston office of a great telegraph company.
The time&mdash;a half century ago. Enter a tall
young man wearing a slouchy, broad-brimmed hat
and a wet duster clinging to his legs, who marches
into the superintendent’s office, and says: “Here I am.” The
superintendent gazes at him. “Who are you?” he finally asks.</p>

<p>“Tom Edison.”</p>

<p>“And who on earth might Tom Edison
be?”</p>

<p>The young man explains that he has
been ordered to report for duty at the
Boston office. He is told to sit down and
wait. A little while later a New York
sender, who is one of the most rapid in the
telegraph business at the time, calls up.</p>

<p>All the operators are busy.</p>

<p>“Let that new fellow try him,” says the
chief.</p>

<p>Edison sits down and for four and one-half
hours takes the speedy messages.
The faster the instrument clicks, the
faster he writes the words. At the end
New York calls:</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>“Hello yourself!” Edison flashes back.</p>

<p>“Who the dickens are you?” asks the
New York operator.</p>

<p>“Tom Edison.”</p>

<p>“You are the first man in the country,
that could ever take me at my fastest,”
clicks out New York, “and the only one
who could ever sit at the other end of my
wire for more than two hours and a half.
I’m proud to know you.”</p>

<p>This little story of Thomas Alva Edison
shows that even as a young man he exhibited
unusual ability. He was born on
February 11, 1847, at Milan, Erie County,
Ohio. His family moved to Port Huron,
Michigan, when the boy was seven, and
when he was only twelve years old Edison
became a train newsboy on the railway to
Detroit. It was during this time that he
rigged up apparatus in the baggage car
and experimented with chemistry and
telegraphy.</p>

<p>He was but fifteen when he became a
telegraph operator. But his studies and
experiments interfered so much with his
duties that he was discharged many times.
He worked in a number of cities of the
United States and Canada. At the age of
twenty-one he had built an automatic
repeater, by which a telegraphic message
could be transferred from one wire to
another without the aid of an operator.
By means of this messages could be sent
direct to a much greater distance than
formerly.</p>

<p>Edison finally went to Boston, as related
herein, and thence to New York, in
1869. There he invented an improved
printing telegraph for stock quotations,
the ticker. For this he received $40,000.</p>

<p>Then he built a laboratory at Newark,
New Jersey; but four years later moved
to Menlo Park, and later to West Orange,
New Jersey. All the time he continued
his experiments and inventions. He lives
now at Orange, and is as hard a worker as
he was when a young man.</p>

<p>Among Edison’s more important inventions
are his system of multiplex telegraphy;
the carbon telephone transmitter;
the phonograph; the incandescent lamp
and light system; the kinetoscope; and
the talking-moving-picture. In all he has
had seven hundred patents granted to
him.</p>

<p>In 1878 Edison was made Chevalier and
afterward Commander of the Legion of
Honor by the French government.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
